# My name is Collin Vesel, and I am a software developer.

My GitHub may not look like much right now, but I have used a lot of tools, and I have a lot of ideas for what I want to make with the experience I got from using them.

The projects I can actually show right now are mostly [homework-type projects](https://github.com/testmaster217/portfolio-hub) from the certificates I've earned in front-end devlopment, back-end development, and DevOps. As you can tell from exploring these projects, I used React and Python (with Django and Flask) heavily for them. I also have a lot of experience with Java and C# from college, but none of those projects made it into my GitHub. (Feel free to ask me about them, though. I'd be happy to explain them!)

In addition, I have a repo for a [personal website](https://github.com/testmaster217/personal-website) that I was working on using Next.js to provide even more proof that I can use the tools that companies might want, but after some time, I realized that this was overkill for what I wanted that website to be and am in the process of rebuilding it from the ground up using HTMX on the front-end and a custom web server on the back-end that I am currently in the process of designing. This server will be written in Go because its powerful standard library will allow me to eliminate the need for 3rd-party dependencies and keep the system as simple as possible, making it easier to maintain and leaving few ways for it to break. (In case you couldn't tell by that whole tangent, I'm pretty excited about this website. 😁)

If you want to reach me, you may email me at [cvesel217@gmail.com](mailto:cvesel217@gmail.com), or if you have LinkedIn Premium, you may message me [there](https://www.linkedin.com/in/collin-vesel-a547901b2/). (I don't use most social media platforms and most of the ones I do use are for personal use only.)
